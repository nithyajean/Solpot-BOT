- `countdown.js` - Countdown timer configuration
- `logger.js` - Logging configuration

### Main Configuration Options

You can modify these constants in `main.js`:

```javascript
// Time between account processing
TIME.DELAY_BETWEEN_ACCOUNTS = 5; // seconds

// API endpoints
API.BASE_URL = "https://solpot.com";
API.ENDPOINTS = {
  PROFILE: "/api/profile/info",
  DAILY_CASE: "/api/daily-case/open",
};
```

```bash
node main.js

2. The bot will:
   - Load all accounts from data.txt
   - Process each account sequentially
   - Wait 5 seconds between accounts
   - Wait 24 hours before starting the next cycle
