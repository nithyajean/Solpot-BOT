```

### How to Get Your Cookie

1. Go to [Solpot](https://solpot.com) and login to your account
2. Open Chrome DevTools:

   - Press `F12` or
   - Right-click anywhere and select "Inspect" or
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac)

3. Go to Network tab in DevTools:

   - Click on the "Network" tab
   - Make sure "Preserve log" is checked

4. Get the cookie:
   - Go to any page on Solpot
   - In Network tab, find any request to `solpot.com`
   - Click on the request
   - In the Headers section, scroll down to find "Cookie"
   - Copy the entire value that starts with `solpotsid=`

Example of cookie format:

```
solpotsid=x%3Au%3A3A75fe516857...rest_of_cookie_value
```

**Note**: Do not share your cookies with anyone. They provide full access to your account.

## Configuration

The bot uses several configuration files located in the `config` folder:

- `banner.js` - ASCII art banner configuration
- `colors.js` - Console color scheme configuration
- `countdown.js` - Countdown timer configuration
- `logger.js` - Logging configuration

### Main Configuration Options

You can modify these constants in `main.js`:

```javascript
// Time between account processing
TIME.DELAY_BETWEEN_ACCOUNTS = 5; // seconds

// API endpoints
API.BASE_URL = "https://solpot.com";
API.ENDPOINTS = {
  PROFILE: "/api/profile/info",
  DAILY_CASE: "/api/daily-case/open",
};
```

## 🔧 Usage

1. Start the bot:

```bash
node main.js
```

2. The bot will:
   - Load all accounts from data.txt
   - Process each account sequentially
   - Wait 5 seconds between accounts
   - Wait 24 hours before starting the next cycle

## Output Example

```

   - Don't share your cookies
   - Use at your own risk

2. **Rate Limiting**

   - The bot includes a delay between accounts to prevent rate limiting
   - Modify `TIME.DELAY_BETWEEN_ACCOUNTS` if needed

   - One cookie per line
   - Make sure there are no empty lines
